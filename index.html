        <h2>Family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 </h2>
        <p>
          I am the eldest of a family of 3 sisters. My parents and my sisters still live in Paris, I try to come back to see them as much as possible 🙃. Moreover, I have a very large family, no less than 20 aunts and uncles and 15 cousins 🤪. 
          They are all very dear to me, we are very close and we spend a lot of time together! ❤️

        <h2>Sport 🏋️‍</h2>
        <p>
          Sport has a very important place in my life: I have been doing intensive gymnastics for 7 years 🤸‍ and I am now part of the Essec cheerleader team. 
          We won the OJOs! 🥇

        <h2>Cinema 🎬</h2>
        <p>
          I love the cinema. I don't necessarily have enough time to see as many films as I would like, but it's part of my daily life. I had the cinema option in high school, which made me discover a lot of techniques. My favorite director is Christopher Nolan ! 🎥
